# Game-Of-Craps
Final of TCSS 305 at UWT

The casino game Craps implemented fully in Java using the AWT with Swing.

First time fully implementing a Model View Controller design pattern myself.

I plan to keep this project updated as I learn new things. An Archive of the project when I first submited it cab be found in the 'archive' branch.
